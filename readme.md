# Visual Studio Title Bar Branch Indicator

This project builds a **VSIX Visual Studio extension** that, when installed, sets the title bar of Visual Studio to display the opened solution name and the current Git branch.

## ‚ú® Why Use This?

If you often have multiple instances of Visual Studio open with different branches of the same solution, it can be difficult to tell which is which. This extension makes it easy by displaying the branch name directly in the title bar.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Displays the solution name and current Git branch in the Visual Studio title bar
- Especially useful when working across multiple branches of the same project
- Lightweight and non-intrusive
